# Tile Packs

This plugin serves as a collection of tile packs you can add and remove quickly and easily, for content all over the game.

These tiles do not interfere with your normal ground markers, they are saved separately.

If you have tiles you would like added, create an issue including the ground markers, or join the Discord.
You can export the ground markers from Runelite by right-clicking the minimap orb.
Use this tool to double-check your exported tiles. https://runelite.net/tile/
